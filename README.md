TalkativeTerminal
=================

Make your bash commands a little bit more animated.

Mac OS X's Terminal includes a easy function that will make it speak to you. All you have to do is type "say" and the words of your choice that will be spoken. Try out "say hello, world" in your terminal. I figured that I could make my regular interactions with the terminal a little bit more exciting if I was spoken to. So I applied this "say" command to my bashrc file. Thus, the TalkativeTerminal was born.

All that this includes is editing common aliases in your bash prfile file to point to functions. These functions include the original command that is associated with the alias, as well as a "say" command.

Use this project as inspiration to write your own, or copy a function to your bashrc file.

1. Open up the terminal app.
2. Type "nano .bash_profile" to add aliases to your bash configuraton (or edit your bash_rc file).
3. After editing, press ctrl+o to save your changes. Press enter to confirm.
4. Exit the nano editor with ctrl+x.
5. Open a new terminal window and write some commands. Listen in awe as your terminal speaks back to you!
